notes:
When i first started writing this code and have what i have above
there is an issue where the model is not predicting the injuries. My guess
is because there is not enough data that show when an injury occurs.

Now I will try to reduce the data so that half is injuries and half is not injuries

after doing that, i am now getting an accuracy of 66% that predicts if a runner is going to be injured or not

now i will try creating synthetic data or duplicates so that we do not remove most of the data

After using synthetic data
